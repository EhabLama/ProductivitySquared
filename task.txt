Imagine you are a developer who has been asked to work on a SharePoint Online Intranet project. Your task is to create a custom component (also referred to as 'webparts') for their Intranet.

 

Please use the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) to create a new custom web part. The webpart should retrieve data from other services as part the functionality - you could use: 

Any API from the Transport for London website (the APIs can be found here: https://api.tfl.gov.uk) OR;  
The Microsoft Graph API to interact with data outside of SharePoint (e.g. Outlook, OneDrive, AAD) OR;  
The SharePoint REST API to interact with SharePoint data  
 The web part should be written using React JS or Angular JS.  

  

We’ll be looking for the following things: 

How you were able to pick up unfamiliar technology (assuming you don't have any SPFx development experience)
How well your code is written  
How cool it looks  
How useful the component might be  
That it deploys and works!  
 Bonus points for integrating Microsoft's design system Fluent UI, or any other interesting libraries. 

  

Please provide us with the source code as well as a packaged .sppkg file so that we can install the web part in our own test environment. 

 

If any additional steps are required to install the web part please document them briefly for us. 

  

This is not meant to be an overly laborious task – we hope that this takes 4 or perhaps 6 hours – and we will be taking this short timeframe into consideration when reviewing your work.
