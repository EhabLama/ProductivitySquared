Project Requirements: Personal Productivity Tracker
Objective:
Develop a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web part that serves as a Personal Productivity Tracker. This web part will integrate with the Microsoft Graph API to display key productivity metrics for the user, including today's calendar events, focused emails, and favorite OneDrive documents. The web part will be developed using React and Fluent UI to ensure a modern and visually appealing interface.
Functional Requirements
Calendar Events:
Fetch and display today's calendar events from the user's Outlook Calendar.
Show event details such as time, title, and location.
2. Focused Emails:
Retrieve and display the user's focused emails from Outlook. If focused emails are not accessible, display the latest 5 emails received.
Show email details such as sender, subject, and a brief snippet of the email body.
Favorite OneDrive Documents:
Fetch and display documents that the user has marked as favorites in OneDrive.
Show document details such as name, type, and last modified date.
Technical Requirements
Microsoft Graph API Integration:
Use Microsoft Graph API to access Outlook Calendar, Outlook Mail, and OneDrive data.
Ensure proper authentication and permissions are set up in Azure AD for accessing user data.
User Interface:
Develop the web part using React and Fluent UI to create a responsive and visually appealing design.
Organize the UI into clear sections for calendar events, emails, and documents.
3. Deployment:
Package the web part as a .sppkg file for deployment to a SharePoint page.
Provide documentation for any additional setup or configuration required.
Design Considerations
Visual Appeal:
Use Fluent UI components to ensure consistency with Microsoft design standards.
Implement a clean and intuitive layout that allows users to quickly access their productivity information.
Responsiveness:
Ensure the web part is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices.
Performance:
Optimize API calls to ensure quick data retrieval and minimal impact on page load times.
Additional Notes
Authentication: Ensure that the web part handles authentication securely, using OAuth 2.0 and Microsoft Identity Platform.
Error Handling: Implement error handling to manage API call failures or data retrieval issues gracefully.
Extensibility: Design the web part with potential future enhancements in mind, such as adding more data sources or features.
This set of requirements provides a clear roadmap for developing the Personal Productivity Tracker web part, ensuring it meets the desired functionality and user experience.
